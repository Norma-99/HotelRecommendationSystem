### Next Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess your dataset. Ensure text reviews are tokenized, normalized, and transformed into suitable features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
2. **Model Selection**: Start with simpler models like linear regression or random forests for a baseline. Then, experiment with more complex models like neural networks or transformers.
3. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like RMSE, MAE for regression models, and precision, recall, F1-score for classification models. For recommendation systems, consider metrics like MAP@K, NDCG.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameters.
5. **Deployment**: Implement the chosen model in your UI using AWS services and GitHub actions for continuous integration and deployment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. **Evaluation and Optimization**

- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
- Optimize models through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

### 6. **Deployment**

Deploy the trained model using AWS SageMaker, Flask API, or any other preferred deployment method. Integrate with the user interface for real-time recommendations.

### Example Deployment with Flask
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import numpy as np

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    processed_review = preprocess_text(data['review'])
    tfidf_features = tfidf_vectorizer.transform([processed_review]).toarray()
    numerical_features = np.array([data['avg_rating'], data['latitude'], data['distance_to_ski_resort'], data['distance_to_city_center']])
    combined_features = np.hstack((tfidf_features, numerical_features.reshape(1, -1)))
    
    prediction = model.predict(combined_features)
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

By following these steps, you can effectively use NLP to extract meaningful information from user reviews and integrate it with other features to build a robust hotel recommendation system.

2. **Dependency on AWS**: Reliance on AWS infrastructure and services can be limiting if you want to migrate to other platforms.
3. **Initial Setup Complexity**: While managed, the initial setup and configuration can be complex.

**Cost Estimation**:
For training with 32K samples, performing 5 model training runs:

- **Instance Type**: `ml.m5.xlarge` (4 vCPUs, 16 GiB memory, good balance for training)
- **Training Time**: Assume each model takes 2 hours for feature extraction and training.
- **Storage**: Assume 50 GB of S3 storage.

**Cost Calculation**:
- Instance cost: $0.192 per hour
- Total instance hours: 2 hours/model * 5 models = 10 hours
- Total instance cost: 10 hours * $0.192/hour = $1.92
- S3 Storage: $0.023 per GB-month
- Total S3 storage cost: 50 GB * $0.023 = $1.15

**Total Cost**: $1.92 (compute) + $1.15 (storage) = $3.07

*Note: This is a basic estimation and actual costs might vary based on exact usage patterns, data transfer, and additional services used.*
