### 1. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**
   - **Why:** TF-IDF is a well-established method that helps identify the importance of words in a document relative to the entire dataset. It balances the frequency of words with their distinctiveness across the dataset, which is crucial when dealing with a large number of reviews.
   - **How:** Convert your text data into a TF-IDF matrix, where each review is represented as a vector. This technique can help you capture the importance of specific words that might correlate strongly with ratings (e.g., "excellent" might correlate with higher ratings).

### 2. **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe):**
   - **Why:** Word embeddings capture the semantic meaning of words in a continuous vector space, where words with similar meanings are close to each other. This is particularly useful for capturing nuances in review text.
   - **How:** You can use pre-trained embeddings or train your own on the review dataset. Each review can be represented by averaging the word vectors (mean embedding) or using more sophisticated approaches like weighted averaging based on TF-IDF scores.

### 3. **N-grams (Bi-grams, Tri-grams):**
   - **Why:** While individual words are informative, certain combinations of words (like "not good," "highly recommend") carry significant meaning. N-grams can help capture these phrases.
   - **How:** Extend your TF-IDF or BoW models to include bi-grams or tri-grams. This can be especially useful if your reviews contain many such meaningful phrases.

### 4. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - **Why:** Sentiment polarity (positive, negative) and intensity can be directly related to the ratings. A strongly positive review is likely to have a higher rating, and vice versa.
   - **How:** Apply a sentiment analysis model (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or even a custom sentiment model) to extract sentiment scores. These scores can be used as additional features alongside TF-IDF or embeddings.

### 5. **Text Length and Readability Scores:**
   - **Why:** The length of the review and its readability might correlate with the detail and thoroughness of the review, which in turn might influence the rating.
   - **How:** Compute features such as the number of words, sentences, and Flesch-Kincaid readability scores for each review. These features can be useful in combination with text-based features.

### 6. **Topic Modeling (LDA - Latent Dirichlet Allocation):**
   - **Why:** LDA can uncover hidden topics within reviews, which might correlate with different ratings. For example, reviews discussing "cleanliness" might have different ratings than those discussing "location."
   - **How:** Use LDA to assign topic probabilities to each review. These topic distributions can serve as features, helping the model understand which aspects of a review contribute to the rating.

### 7. **BERT or Transformer-based Embeddings:**
   - **Why:** Transformer-based models like BERT capture context at a much deeper level, understanding nuances and word dependencies that traditional methods might miss. This can be especially powerful for capturing complex relationships in the text.
   - **How:** You can use pre-trained BERT embeddings or fine-tune a BERT model on your dataset. Extract embeddings from the [CLS] token, which can represent the entire review, and use these embeddings as features.


For the project, we will start with a combination of **TF-IDF** (as a baseline for feature extraction), **word embeddings** (for capturing semantic information), and **sentiment analysis** (to introduce sentiment as a predictive feature). These techniques strike a good balance between simplicity, interpretability, and performance.
