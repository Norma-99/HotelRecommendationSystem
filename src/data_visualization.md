The plot visualizes the distribution of values for each feature extracted from the `review_text_features` column in your dataset. Each subplot represents the distribution of one of the features across all reviews, showing how frequently each value occurs.


### Next Steps:

1. **Further Analysis**: You might want to analyze individual features in more detail to understand what they represent.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Consider how these features can be used in your machine learning models. You might need to transform or scale the data based on their distributions.
3. **Outlier Handling**: Decide how to handle outliers—whether to keep, transform, or remove them—depending on their impact on your models.
