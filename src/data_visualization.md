To visualize your data and determine which features are useful for your NLP model, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Load the CSV File into a Pandas DataFrame

First, download your preprocessed CSV file from your S3 bucket to your local machine or a Jupyter Notebook environment. Then, load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

### Step 2: Visualize the Data

You can use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize your data. For example, you can create histograms to understand the distribution of ratings, bar plots to visualize the number of reviews per hotel, and word clouds to see the most frequent words in the reviews.

### Step 3: Feature Engineering

1. **Tokenization**: Split the reviews into individual words or tokens.
2. **Stop Words Removal**: Remove common words that do not carry significant meaning (e.g., "and", "the").
3. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form.
4. **N-grams**: Consider sequences of n words together (e.g., bigrams, trigrams).
5. **TF-IDF**: Calculate term frequency-inverse document frequency to weigh the importance of words.

### Step 4: Feature Selection for NLP Model

To determine which features are useful for your NLP model, you can start by exploring some common features used in text classification:

1. **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represents text as a collection of word frequencies.
2. **TF-IDF Vectors**: Weighs words by their importance across all documents.
3. **Word Embeddings**: Use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT for semantic representation of words.


### Step 5: Model Training and Evaluation

Once you have prepared your features, you can train an NLP model. Common models include:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Deep Learning Models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer-based models like BERT)**

By following these steps, you can visualize your data, preprocess it for NLP tasks, and train a model to evaluate the usefulness of different features.

You can also use AWS Quicksight but I have to investigate further about that.
