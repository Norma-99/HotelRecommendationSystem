To visualize your data and determine which features are useful for your NLP model, you can follow these steps:

## Step 1: Load the CSV File into a Pandas DataFrame

First, download your preprocessed CSV file from your S3 bucket to your local machine or a Jupyter Notebook environment. Then, load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

## Step 2: Visualize the Data

You can use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize your data. For example, you can create histograms to understand the distribution of ratings, bar plots to visualize the number of reviews per hotel, and word clouds to see the most frequent words in the reviews.

To effectively visualize your data for an NLP network focusing on hotel reviews in Andorra, you should consider a combination of plots and statistics that provide insights into the distribution, trends, and characteristics of your dataset. Here are some suggestions for attributes and plots that would be useful:

### 1. Distribution of Ratings
- **Histogram of Ratings:** Visualize the distribution of hotel ratings.
- **Average Rating per Region:** Bar chart showing the average rating of hotels in each region.

### 2. Reviews Analysis
- **Number of Reviews per Hotel:** Bar chart showing the total number of reviews for each hotel.
- **Review Ratings Distribution:** Histogram of review ratings to understand the sentiment distribution.
- **Review Count over Time:** Line chart showing the number of reviews over time to identify trends.

### 3. Text Analysis
- **Word Cloud of Review Text:** Highlight the most frequent words in the reviews.
- **Language Distribution:** Pie chart showing the distribution of review languages.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Bar chart or pie chart showing the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments in reviews.

### 4. Comparison between Regions
- **Average Rating Comparison:** Bar chart comparing average ratings between different regions.
- **Review Count Comparison:** Bar chart comparing the number of reviews between regions.
- **Sentiment Comparison:** Bar chart comparing sentiment distributions across regions.

### 5. Business Status Analysis
- **Business Status Distribution:** Pie chart showing the distribution of business status (open, closed, etc.).


### Implementation in Python

Here's a sample implementation to visualize some of these attributes using Python and Matplotlib:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Assuming you have your data in a DataFrame named df
df = pd.read_csv("hotels_data.csv")

# 1. Distribution of Ratings
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(df['rating'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Hotel Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# 2. Average Rating per Region
avg_rating_region = df.groupby('region')['rating'].mean().sort_values()
avg_rating_region.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(12, 6), color='coral', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Average Hotel Rating per Region')
plt.xlabel('Region')
plt.ylabel('Average Rating')
plt.show()

# 3. Reviews Analysis
# 3.1 Number of Reviews per Hotel
reviews_per_hotel = df['hotel_name'].value_counts().head(20)
reviews_per_hotel.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(12, 6), color='lightgreen', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Number of Reviews per Hotel (Top 20)')
plt.xlabel('Hotel Name')
plt.ylabel('Number of Reviews')
plt.show()

# 3.2 Review Ratings Distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(df['review_rating'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Distribution of Review Ratings')
plt.xlabel('Review Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# 4. Text Analysis
# 4.1 Word Cloud of Review Text
text = ' '.join(df['review_text'].dropna())
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400, background_color='white').generate(text)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Word Cloud of Review Text')
plt.show()

# 4.2 Language Distribution
language_dist = df['review_language'].value_counts()
language_dist.plot(kind='pie', figsize=(8, 8), autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140, colors=['lightblue', 'lightgreen', 'coral', 'orange'])
plt.title('Distribution of Review Languages')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()

# Additional plots for sentiment analysis, review trends over time, etc., can be implemented similarly.
```

### Recommendations for NLP Network Preparation
1. **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopwords removal.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Consider features like the length of reviews, sentiment scores, and key phrases.
3. **Data Balancing:** Ensure a balanced distribution of classes if you're performing classification tasks.
4. **Train-Test Split:** Maintain an appropriate train-test split, considering temporal splits if analyzing trends over time.




## Step 3: Feature Engineering

1. **Tokenization**: Split the reviews into individual words or tokens.
2. **Stop Words Removal**: Remove common words that do not carry significant meaning (e.g., "and", "the").
3. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form.
4. **N-grams**: Consider sequences of n words together (e.g., bigrams, trigrams).
5. **TF-IDF**: Calculate term frequency-inverse document frequency to weigh the importance of words.

## Step 4: Feature Selection for NLP Model

To determine which features are useful for your NLP model, you can start by exploring some common features used in text classification:

1. **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represents text as a collection of word frequencies.
2. **TF-IDF Vectors**: Weighs words by their importance across all documents.
3. **Word Embeddings**: Use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT for semantic representation of words.


## Step 5: Model Training and Evaluation

Once you have prepared your features, you can train an NLP model. Common models include:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Deep Learning Models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer-based models like BERT)**

By following these steps, you can visualize your data, preprocess it for NLP tasks, and train a model to evaluate the usefulness of different features.

You can also use AWS Quicksight but I have to investigate further about that.

Distinguishing between different data layers (raw data, L1 data, L2 data, and L3 data) is a common practice in data engineering and data science to manage the data transformation process effectively. Each layer represents a different stage of data processing, from the initial collection to the final form ready for analysis or modeling. Here are the definitions for each:

### Raw Data
**Definition:**
- Raw data, also known as source data, is the unprocessed data collected directly from the source. It is the initial form of data that has not undergone any cleaning, transformation, or processing.

**Characteristics:**
- Contains all original data points, including duplicates, errors, and irrelevant information.
- Typically in a format that is difficult to analyze directly (e.g., JSON logs, raw text files, sensor data).
- May include various types of data such as text, numbers, images, and more.

**Example:**
- Raw sensor data from IoT devices.
- Unstructured customer feedback from a feedback form.
- Raw log files from a web server.

### L1 Data (Level 1 Data)
**Definition:**
- L1 data is the cleaned and structured version of raw data. At this stage, basic data cleaning and transformation operations are performed to make the data more usable.

**Characteristics:**
- Removal of obvious errors and inconsistencies.
- Handling of missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).
- Basic transformations such as type casting, normalization, and filtering of irrelevant data.

**Example:**
- Cleaned and structured sensor data with missing values filled and incorrect entries removed.
- Structured customer feedback with standardized fields and basic text preprocessing applied.

### L2 Data (Level 2 Data)
**Definition:**
- L2 data is the processed and enriched data. It involves more complex transformations, feature engineering, and data integration from multiple sources to add more context and value.

**Characteristics:**
- Advanced transformations and feature engineering.
- Integration and merging of data from different sources.
- Derived metrics and features created for further analysis.

**Example:**
- Sensor data combined with weather data to provide context for sensor readings.
- Customer feedback data enriched with customer demographic information and sentiment scores.

### L3 Data (Level 3 Data)
**Definition:**
- L3 data is the final, analysis-ready data. It is fully processed, cleaned, and transformed, ready for use in advanced analytics, reporting, or machine learning models.

**Characteristics:**
- Fully processed and validated.
- Suitable for direct consumption by analytics tools or machine learning algorithms.
- Often includes aggregated data and key performance indicators (KPIs).

**Example:**
- Aggregated sensor data providing daily average readings along with anomaly detection flags.
- Customer feedback data summarized with overall satisfaction scores and key insights.

### Visual Representation

Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate the data transformation process:

```
Raw Data --> L1 Data --> L2 Data --> L3 Data
[Unprocessed]  [Cleaned & Structured]  [Processed & Enriched]  [Analysis-Ready]
```

### Practical Implementation Example

Let’s consider an example workflow for a hotel recommendation system:

1. **Raw Data:**
   - Original reviews, ratings, and metadata collected from Google Places API.
   - Includes all raw text, images, and metadata without any preprocessing.

2. **L1 Data:**
   - Cleaned reviews and ratings, where missing values are handled, and irrelevant fields are removed.
   - Basic text cleaning (e.g., removal of HTML tags, lowercasing).

3. **L2 Data:**
   - Enriched reviews with additional features like sentiment scores, language translation.
   - Integration with other data sources such as hotel amenities and location data.
   - Feature engineering to create new columns like review length, average rating per hotel, etc.

4. **L3 Data:**
   - Final dataset ready for training the recommendation model.
   - Aggregated features, such as average sentiment score per hotel, overall ratings distribution.
   - Data split into training, validation, and test sets for model development.

By distinguishing between these data layers, you can maintain a clear and structured workflow, ensuring that each stage of data processing is well-defined and managed. This approach enhances data quality, traceability, and reproducibility, which are critical for effective data science and machine learning projects.

5. **Interactive Dashboards**:
   - Use `Streamlit` or `Dash` for interactive web applications.
   - Deploy these apps on Heroku or EC2 for cost-effective hosting.

### Example Workflow

#### 1. Develop and Refine Visualizations Locally

Create and refine your visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks:

```python
# Example: A simple Plotly graph in a Jupyter Notebook
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/l1_data_2024-07-21_16-33-02.csv')
fig = px.histogram(df, x='rating', nbins=20, title='Distribution of Hotel Ratings')
fig.show()
```

#### 2. Convert Notebooks to HTML

Use `nbconvert` to convert notebooks to HTML:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html --no-input your_notebook.ipynb
```

#### 3. Automate with GitHub Actions

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the conversion and upload to S3:

```yaml
name: Convert and Upload Notebooks

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install jupyter nbconvert boto3

    - name: Convert notebooks to HTML
      run: |
        jupyter nbconvert --to html --no-input notebooks/*.ipynb

    - name: Upload to S3
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      run: |
        aws s3 sync notebooks/ s3://andorra-hotels-data-warehouse/notebooks/
```

#### 4. Host on Amazon S3

1. **Create and configure an S3 bucket**:

    ```bash
    aws s3 mb s3://andorra-hotels-data-warehouse
    aws s3 website s3://andorra-hotels-data-warehouse --index-document index.html
    ```

2. **Upload your website files to the S3 bucket**:

    ```bash
    aws s3 sync ./notebooks s3://andorra-hotels-data-warehouse/notebooks/
    ```

#### 5. Create Interactive Dashboards

Use `Streamlit` or `Dash` for interactive visualizations:

```python
# Example: A simple Streamlit app
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

df = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/l1_data_2024-07-21_16-33-02.csv')

st.title('Hotel Reviews Dashboard')

# Histogram of ratings
fig = px.histogram(df, x='rating', nbins=20, title='Distribution of Hotel Ratings')
st.plotly_chart(fig)

# Language Distribution
language_dist = df['review_language'].value_counts()
st.bar_chart(language_dist)
```

Deploy this Streamlit app on Heroku:

1. **Create a `requirements.txt`** with the necessary dependencies:

    ```txt
    streamlit
    pandas
    plotly
    ```

2. **Create a `Procfile`** with the following content:

    ```txt
    web: streamlit run your_script.py
    ```

3. **Deploy to Heroku**:

    ```bash
    heroku create your-app-name
    git push heroku main
    ```

### Notes:
- **Voila** can be used to convert and serve Jupyter Notebooks without code cells:

    ```bash
    voila your_notebook.ipynb
    ```

- Ensure that your AWS credentials are securely stored in GitHub Secrets to allow GitHub Actions to upload files to S3.

By following this approach, you can create professional, interactive visualizations without incurring significant costs. Leveraging GitHub for automation, S3 for hosting, and tools like Streamlit for interactive dashboards provides a robust and cost-effective solution.
