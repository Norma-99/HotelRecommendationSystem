To visualize your data and determine which features are useful for your NLP model, you can follow these steps:

## Step 1: Load the CSV File into a Pandas DataFrame

First, download your preprocessed CSV file from your S3 bucket to your local machine or a Jupyter Notebook environment. Then, load the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

## Step 2: Visualize the Data

You can use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize your data. For example, you can create histograms to understand the distribution of ratings, bar plots to visualize the number of reviews per hotel, and word clouds to see the most frequent words in the reviews.

To effectively visualize your data for an NLP network focusing on hotel reviews in Andorra, you should consider a combination of plots and statistics that provide insights into the distribution, trends, and characteristics of your dataset. Here are some suggestions for attributes and plots that would be useful:

### 1. Distribution of Ratings
- **Histogram of Ratings:** Visualize the distribution of hotel ratings.
- **Average Rating per Region:** Bar chart showing the average rating of hotels in each region.

### 2. Reviews Analysis
- **Number of Reviews per Hotel:** Bar chart showing the total number of reviews for each hotel.
- **Review Ratings Distribution:** Histogram of review ratings to understand the sentiment distribution.
- **Review Count over Time:** Line chart showing the number of reviews over time to identify trends.

### 3. Text Analysis
- **Word Cloud of Review Text:** Highlight the most frequent words in the reviews.
- **Language Distribution:** Pie chart showing the distribution of review languages.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Bar chart or pie chart showing the distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments in reviews.

### 4. Comparison between Regions
- **Average Rating Comparison:** Bar chart comparing average ratings between different regions.
- **Review Count Comparison:** Bar chart comparing the number of reviews between regions.
- **Sentiment Comparison:** Bar chart comparing sentiment distributions across regions.

### 5. Business Status Analysis
- **Business Status Distribution:** Pie chart showing the distribution of business status (open, closed, etc.).

### Recommendations for NLP Network Preparation
1. **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopwords removal.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Consider features like the length of reviews, sentiment scores, and key phrases.
3. **Data Balancing:** Ensure a balanced distribution of classes if you're performing classification tasks.
4. **Train-Test Split:** Maintain an appropriate train-test split, considering temporal splits if analyzing trends over time.

## Step 3: Feature Engineering

1. **Tokenization**: Split the reviews into individual words or tokens.
2. **Stop Words Removal**: Remove common words that do not carry significant meaning (e.g., "and", "the").
3. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form.
4. **N-grams**: Consider sequences of n words together (e.g., bigrams, trigrams).
5. **TF-IDF**: Calculate term frequency-inverse document frequency to weigh the importance of words.

## Step 4: Feature Selection for NLP Model

To determine which features are useful for your NLP model, you can start by exploring some common features used in text classification:

1. **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represents text as a collection of word frequencies.
2. **TF-IDF Vectors**: Weighs words by their importance across all documents.
3. **Word Embeddings**: Use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT for semantic representation of words.


## Step 5: Model Training and Evaluation

Once you have prepared your features, you can train an NLP model. Common models include:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Deep Learning Models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer-based models like BERT)**

By following these steps, you can visualize your data, preprocess it for NLP tasks, and train a model to evaluate the usefulness of different features.

You can also use AWS Quicksight but I have to investigate further about that.
