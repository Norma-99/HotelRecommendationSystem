# COURSE OF ACTION

- [X] Take out NLP entirely from L3 preprocessing. (1h)
- [X] Do a visualization dashboard with all the NLP techniques and decide which one is the one we should select. (3h)
- [X] Create a `data_preprocessing_nlp.py` where all the necessary transformations before the model will be performed (also chosen NLP techniques). (2h)
- [X] Re-write L1, L2 sections with modifications made (2h)
- [X] Write L3 preprocessing section (1h)
- [X] Fix L1 and L2 visualization notebooks, prettify NLP visualization notebook and fix visualization GA (3h)
- [X] Write NLP section (2h)
- [X] Write NLP results (3h)
- [X] Select my model label and evaluation metrics. (4h)
- [X] Create a basic ML model that uses my preprocessed data and the selected evaluation metrics. (2h)
- [X] Analyze the results and create a way to evaluate the ML models created (2h)
- [ ] Fine tune the model and add a configuration file with multiple models (4h) -- MON
- [ ] Train multiple models and evaluate them (select best fitted model and create a perf dash) (4h) -- TUES
- [ ] Create a full visualization pipeline for the model results (4h) -- WED
- [ ] Trigger the GitHub Action so the model training works as expected (2h) -- THU
- [ ] Investigate the idea of adding MLFlow to the training pipeline (4h) -- FRI & SAT
- [ ] Explain why we did not use Sagemaker and our training choices (4h) -- SUN, MON & TUES
- [ ] The supervised learning section architecture, both in GH and in Overleaf (2h) -- TUES
- [ ] Draw the architectural diagram (1h) -- WED
- [ ] Explain model results (4h) -- THU
- [ ] Write first conclusions about findings (2h) -- FRI

If everything goes according to plan, I will finish the bulk of the architecture and work on the 29th of September.
